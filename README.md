# Resume Project

Welcome to my personal resume project. Harnessing the power of JavaScript/React, through an impressive package from "React-pdf" (react-pdf.org), I'm able to showcase my technical skillset by using code to generate my professional resume. Is there even a better way for a developer to create their latest resume? Design cues inspired by VSCode Themes “Dark Modern” & “Light Modern” to bring even more personality to the content. Thanks for stopping by and checking out my project!
